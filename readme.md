# Detectron2 Sample Deployment
## Why this
Deploying a detectron based RNN model is diffcult. In spite of the offical guide of deployment, it's hard to compile the environment for caffe2 or stuff like that. I know little about C++ and Linux, and most of the ML frameworks are not supporting Windows.
Anyway, My app is simple and I'm not worrying about the performance. I just want it works, and I'm saving my time.
## What's this
This is an interface for other programs to get the predict data of the detectron2 based RNN detecter.
## usage
The model file should be put in `engine/output/model_final.pth`, which is not included here.
